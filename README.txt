tl;dnr = Don't use this branch.  Use energystem-process.

Longer version:

This is a version of TEMOA that was coded against Coopr v2.  Coopr
v3 had various syntax and non-compatible API changes that prompted
us to create a new branch.  However, while Coopr v3 was in
development, we kept this branch up-to-date with our -Coopr3 branch.
Now that Coopr v3 has been released, this branch is no longer
maintained.
