tl;dnr = Don't use this branch.  Use energysystem/ in trunk or
energystem-process-Coopr3.

Longer version:
This is a version of TEMOA that was coded against Coopr v2.  Coopr
v3 had various syntax and non-compatible API changes that prompted
us to create a new branch.  However, while Coopr v3 was in
development, we kept this branch up-to-date with our -Coopr3 branch
for awhile.  Now that Coopr v3 has been released, this branch is no
longer maintained.
