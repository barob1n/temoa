TemoaDB
=======

TemoaDB is a web frontend to a relational database backend for storing Temoa
energy modeling data.

Goals:

 * To have a relational database schema enforce energy modeling data
   constraints
 * To have a usable frontend to the RDBMS, so that using TemoaDB does not
   require a degree in computer science.
 * To enable free and open data sharing for EEO modelers.
 * To be approachable and modifiable by actual EEO modelers for their needs.
