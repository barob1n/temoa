This is an old, only partially useful branch of TEMOA.  Specifically, it was
based on the assumption that the basic unit of measurement of the energysystem
was the flow between two processes.  The major drawback to this is that it
precludes the representation of more than one flow between two processes,
which though most common, is not true of all real-world processes.
