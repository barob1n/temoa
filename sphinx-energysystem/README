Summary
----------------------------------
This directory contains configuration files to generate automatic documentation from the model source code. 

Run 
----------------------------------
ASSUMPTION: We assume that that model source code is in "../elc" directory from this location.
If that's not the case, you need to update conf.py line number 19 to reflect the correct path of the model source code.

Execute "./run.sh" in this directory to build the updated documentation from model source code and then upload to the temoaproject.org website.
The updated documentation can then be viewed from http://temoaproject.org/docs

To just build the updated documentation on the local machine, please run "make html" in this directory.
